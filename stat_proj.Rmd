## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
install.packages('sgt')
install.packages('ggplot2')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(sgt)
library(ggplot2)

# These are all set to pre-determined values
mu = 0
sigma = 1
p = 2
sample_size = 20

# List of lambdas and qs to vary
lambdas = c(0,.99)
qs = c(1, 5, 10, 50)
ns = c(5,10,15,20,25)

Data_Frame <- data.frame (
  lambda = c(),
  q = c(),
  n = c(),
  statistic = c()
)

lambda = .9
q = Inf

means = c()

# For each lambda, q, and n value:
for (lambda in lambdas) {
  for (q in qs) {
    for (n in ns) {
      # Calculate sample_size sample means
      means <- c()
      for (i in 1:sample_size) {
        data <- rsgt(n, mu = mu, sigma = sigma, lambda = lambda, p = 2, q = q)
        means <- append(means, mean(data))
      }
      print(length(means))
      stat <- shapiro.test(means)
      Data_Frame <- rbind(Data_Frame, c(lambda, q, n, stat))
      plot=qplot(x, data=data, geom="histogram") 
      name <- sprintf("%s_%s_%s.pdf", lambda, q, n)
      ggsave(plot,file=name)
    }
  }
}

#for (i in 1:5) {
#  data <- rsgt(n, mu = mu, sigma = sigma, lambda = lambda, p = 2, q = q)
#  # Calculate the sample mean
#  m <- mean(data)
#  means <- append(means, m)
#}

shapiro.test(means)
hist(means)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
